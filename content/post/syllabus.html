<td align="left">Introduction to effective altruism.</td>
<td align="left">The students will be introduced to the Effective Altruism movement. What is EA? Who funded the movement and what was the motivation behind it? What are its main goals and which methodologies do they use to achieve them?</td>
<td align="left">Effective altruism</td>
<td align="left">We will go over different examples of real interventions and have polls on which ones the students believe had positive effects. We will then discuss why they think that’s the case, go over the actual results of those interventions, and that will help us start introducing the EA concepts.</td>

<td align="left">Evaluating evidence: the power of data.</td>
<td align="left">EA relies on data. How is data used to evaluate different actions and decide which one is more impactful? This will be introduced using examples of organizations that make constant use of it, like J-PAL.</td>

<td align="left">After having been introduced to evidence evaluation during the first hour of the class, the students will be given a hypothetical case of an intervention that a nonprofit wants to implement in a developing country. They will then need to come up with a strategy to implement it in such a way that the evidence can be analyzed and discuss their ideas for posterior analysis.</td>

<p>1/16/2020 Charity evaluation: GiveWell’s model. We will study the example of an EA driven organization that uses data to evaluate existing charity organizations (GiveWell), go over their methods to do it, and compare them to those of the main used charity evaluator (Charity Navigator). Models After having been introduced to GiveWell, and their methods to evaluate charities, I will hand a description with data from some existing organizations to the students and we will try to come up with a GiveWelllike model to assess their impact.<br />
Overhead<br />
1/17/2020 How to measure impact in lives?: DALYs and QALYs. We will review the metrics that people in the field of global health use to assess the impact of different conditions on human life. DALYs After having been introduced to the DALYs and QALYs, the students will be handed examples of interventions that improve peoples lives (for example a cataract surgery, a polio vaccine, AIDS medication). They will then use DALYs and QALYs to estimate how much those measures can improve people’s lives.<br />
QALYs<br />
LAYs<br />
1/18/2020 Cause areas within EA. Explore some of the cause areas that EA considers the most important to help the world: long-termism, global health and poverty, animal welfare, AI. Longtermism The students will be divided into 4 groups and each will be handed a description of one cause area. They will have time to read it and discuss the importance in their groups and we’ll then do a group debate in which each team will argue in favor of their area and explain why it’s important.<br />
Global catastrophic risk<br />
1/21/2020 Charity pitches discussion. Over the weekend, the students will have submitted a brief charity pitch, proposing to fund a charity organization of their choosing, and using the concepts we’ve covered the previous week to justify their decision. During this class, we will discuss some of the charity pitches submitted by the students. The students will take turns to introduce the charity they chose and explain why they did it using the principles we were exposed to during the first week.<br />
1/22/2020 Cause prioritization. We will learn to assign priorities to different areas, and to specific interventions within those areas. Cause prioritization The students will have been assigned a reading on cause prioritization by 80000 hours. In class, we will discuss what they read, and use those methods to try to assign priorities to a list of areas and interventions that I’ll give them.<br />
Think tank<br />
1/23/2020 Charity entrepreneurship. We will learn about charity entrepreneurship, and how people are trying to incorporate the concepts we’ve learned about to start impactful organizations. We will talk about some of the characteristics needed to be a charity entrepreneur and different actions to get started. Social entrepreneurship We will watch Joey Savoie’s talk on charity entrepreneurship. We will then discuss the potential implications of it.<br />
1/24/2020 Success stories in helping the world. Introduce the students to several examples of people or organizations that made use of data evidence to have a successful impact with their actions. The class will be divided in groups and each group will be assigned a real ‘success story’ in helping the world using data. We will then reconvene, and each group will introduce their example. We will group discuss how the examples made use of the concepts we studied.<br />
1/25/2020 Impactful ideas discussion and final thoughts. We will host a final session going over the things we’ve learned in the past to weeks and thinking about potential impactful ideas that could be developed to help the world. We will have a group discussion on impactful ideas. We will first come up with ‘big areas’ that might be worth exploring, and then of specific interventions that could be applied for each area.<br />
We will finish the class by talking about some of the many EA resources that students can use to broaden their knowledge or participation in the future (these are also present in the website, which will be mentioned in the first class).</p>
